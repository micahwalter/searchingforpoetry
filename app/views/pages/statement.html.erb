<p>This project is an investigation of how we consume the written word. Searching for poetry, simply put, takes your favorite poems and instead of allowing you to read them, reads them to you via a few popular search engines. Each line is entered into Google or Bing and the results are displayed. Don't worry, you don't have to do anything. Just sit back and watch the poetry get found.</p>
